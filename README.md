# Groovy Closure Exception Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to exception handling in Groovy closures.  The issue occurs when an exception is thrown within a closure passed to a method. Under certain conditions, the code following the closure's execution might not be reached, even if an exception is caught.

## Bug Description

The primary problem lies in how exceptions are handled when they originate within a closure. While a try-catch block might appear to handle the exception correctly, unexpected program behavior can manifest. For instance, the code after the catch block might not execute as expected.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.groovy`. Observe the output.
3. Compare the observed output with the expected output, noting the potential absence of the 'After closure execution' message in the bug scenario.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing exception handling mechanisms within Groovy closures. Ensure that the try-catch block effectively intercepts and handles the exception without disrupting the normal program flow.  The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a corrected implementation.
