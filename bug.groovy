```groovy
def methodWithClosure(closure) {
  println "Before closure execution"
  closure()
  println "After closure execution"
}

methodWithClosure { println "Inside closure" }

//The bug is that this code will print "Before closure execution", "Inside closure", and "After closure execution" as expected.
//However, if the closure throws an exception:

def methodWithClosureThrowingException(closure) {
  println "Before closure execution"
  try {
    closure()
  } catch (Exception e) {
    println "Exception caught: "+ e.message
  }
  println "After closure execution"
}

methodWithClosureThrowingException { throw new RuntimeException("Something went wrong") }

//This will print "Before closure execution", "Exception caught: Something went wrong", and "After closure execution".
//However, in some cases, the "After closure execution" might not be printed.
//This happens when the exception is not handled properly and the program crashes, or in cases where the exception prevents the flow from reaching the println("After closure execution") statement.
//This is an uncommon and subtle bug, because it only appears under specific circumstances where an exception is thrown inside the closure and it's not handled effectively within the method.
